# 🎬 Movie Recommendation Backend

## 🚀 Real-World Application

This backend system replicates real-world engineering scenarios where performance, security, and API clarity are paramount. By completing this project, I have gained proficiency in:

- Building and documenting scalable APIs
- Implementing Redis-based caching strategies
- Designing secure authentication workflows

## 📘 Overview

This Django-powered backend serves a movie recommendation platform, offering APIs for:

- Trending and recommended movie retrieval
- User authentication (JWT)
- Saving favorite movie preferences

It prioritizes performance optimization through caching and follows documentation best practices via Swagger.
